            <h2>Welcome to Your POI Tracker!</h2>
            <p>
                Here you will track Points of Interest that you are debating on visiting on your travels.
                In "Locations" you can see all your saved locations with both the arrival, and departure times. You can also save a new location for your trip. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the navigation bar at the top of your screen you can select any saved location, for which each button is in blue, to view saved Points Of Interest(POIs) or to search for POIs.
                On the Points of Interest page you can upvote and downvote a POI.  In future developments this will allow for multiple users to give input on preferred POIs within a shared trip.
