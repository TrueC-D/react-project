            <p>
                Here you will track Points of Interest that you are debating on visiting on your travels.
                In Locations you can see all your saved locations, the visit start date and the visit end date.
                In the navigation bar at the top of your screen you can select any saved location to view saved Points Of Interest(POIs) or to search for POIs.
                On the Points of Interest page you can upvote and downvote a POI.  In future developments this will allow for multiple users to give input on preferred POIs within a shared trip.
